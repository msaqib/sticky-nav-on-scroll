            <p>Global warming is a real phenomenon. It is a threat to our very existence. It is estimated that 
                by the year 2050, we will be unable to sustain. With unchecked industrialization and commercialization,
                we have caused serious harm to plant and animal life on earth.</p> 
                <p>The global eco system has been badly damaged.
                Many creatures are near extinction. The sea temperatures are rising, causing serious threat to the 
                ocean life. The glaciers are melting at an alarming pace. Yet, we are not acting.
            </p>
            <p>We are a global consortium of organizations, and individuals campaigning for climate action. We have
                started various practical intiatives. This includes tree plantation campaigns, creating animal habitats, 
                protecting river life systems, and much more. Our various programs have created real measurable impact.
